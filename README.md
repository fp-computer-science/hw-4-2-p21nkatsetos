### Nested and Chained Conditionals
---

Answer each of the following questions in a separate Python file named `hw4-2-#.py` where `#` is the number of the question. In your heading, put your name and the date you began working on the file. Be sure to write each program in a way that allows you to swap values to make the program more versatile.


1. On page 4 of the Fairfield Prep Student/Parent Handbook, there is an explanation of the grading system and how numerical averages are converted to letter grades. Write a program that allows a user to input their numerical average for a quarter and have their letter grade displayed. Be sure to use nested if/if-else statements or chained elif statements.

2. Write a program to calculate a person's BMI and return what the intrepretation of their BMI is. The program should prompt the user for their height and weight, calculate their BMI, and then display what category they fall into. Be sure to use nested if/if-else statements or chained elif statements.

    |   BMI   | Intrepretation  |
    |:-------:|:---------------:|
    |    < 19 | Underweight     |
    | 19 < 25 | Healthy         |
    | 25 < 30 | Overweight      |
    | 30 < 40 | Obese           |
    | 40 >    | Extremely Obese |
